# `RTIC examples`

> Here you can find examples on different aspects of the RTIC scheduler.

## Structure

This repo does have example applications based on RTIC framework for popular hardware platforms (for example nRF series and Bluepill).

## Requirements

To run these examples, you need to have working environment as described in [Installing the tools](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/intro/install.html) chapter of **The Embedded Rust Book**.

Short list:

* Rust and cargo
* Toolchain for your microcontroller
* OpenOCD

## Contributing
New examples are always welcome!

## External examples

Some projects maintain RTIC examples in their own repository. Follow these links to find more RTIC examples.

- The [`teensy4-rs` project](https://github.com/mciantyre/teensy4-rs) maintains `RTIC v1.0` examples that run on the Teensy 4.0 and 4.1.
